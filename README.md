A data analysis project that aims to provide an brief overview  of 
covid19 situation through various charts. This project will be done with 
the assistance from streamlit package that's available in python. 

Note: There are two different csv files in the folder. One csv file is created from 
web scraping , other was made from scratch. The format of web scraped version 
looks disorganized, because the website that is scraped uses dynamic table structure.
If interested, other data files that are available online can also be used in this 
project. Few websites I highly recommened are: 
1. https:github.com/CSSEGISandData/Covid-19 provided by John Hopkin University.
2. https:covid19.who.int/data provided by WHO.
Since those csv files contained different parameters/column names, be sure to rename them before 
running the app.

Few improvements(改进) that can also be done:
1. Adds few more style to the streamlit app. 
2. Clean up web scraped csv file in depth.
3. Make the app responsive.
